# HellasAIO

This is a Greek Sneaker bot I wrote over the summer, and a bit after. It works very well, however, the Greek market is quite small, they rarely drop, and the cancels on the main site, BuzzSneakers, are unbearable. Hopefully, someone can build off this, learn, and make a bot of their own. It was a great experience building this myself.

What it includes:
- Modified @pristine#1862 bot base
- Full HellasAIO Bot Go Source (Fuel GR, TAF GR, BuzzSneakers GR)
- Bot Auto-Update + Loader
- Remote Quicktasking (Frontend + Backend)
- Helheim API (Written using FastAPI)
- Auth API
- Fuel Monitor (with cloudflare support)
- BuzzSneakers Monitor

# Guide

You must remove the auth + quicktask websocket in order for it to run. Then, you gotta compile it. (go1.16.15)
